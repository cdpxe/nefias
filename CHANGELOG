 - add new script to that can detect message ordering CCs in TCP seq. #
   (Wendzel, 2019)
 - add new scripts to detect CCs embedded in MQTT topics and MQTT arti-
   ficial re-connect channels (Mileva et al., 2020)
 - add several new detection scripts written by Kevin Albrechts using
   epsilon similarity on different hiding patterns
 - substantially extended the documentation, in particular:
   - add comment on how to run parallel computations on a slave node
   - add comment on addressing errors related to limited stack size
   - several additional improvements of documentation
   - added some new readme files to describe traffic recorings and
     detection scripts
MINOR:
 - support TCP ack and seq numbers by default
 - tiny improvements of code and directory structure; added some sample
   traffic recrodings
 - add kappa framelen+IAT versions that support multiple window sizes
 - allow to search for flows that are either TCP or UDP via "udp+tcp"
 - add -add-values="..." parameter to nefias_master
SECURITY FIXES:
 - none
FIXES:
 - fix handling of IPv6 flows
 - make sure ./results, $SLAVE_SCRIPT, $SLAVE_HOSTCONFIG, $TRAFFIC_SOURCE files
   exist (and that ./results is a directory)
 - fix pre-calculation of required chunks in string output
 - improved error handling in pcapng2csv.sh
 - slightly improved error checking in scripts/nefias_lib.sh
 - check whether certain provided cmdline parameters are just param=  (empty)
